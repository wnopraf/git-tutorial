In the absence of any other proof, the thumb alone would convince me of God's existence.


What goes up must come down.
My powers are ordinary. Only my application brings me success.
Nothing strengthens authority so much as silence.
Why does the eye see a thing more clearly in dreams than the imagination when awake?
